### Attempt 1 notes

The released texture initialization delegates to the wave-texture menu initializer.

`KELLY_DECOMP_COMPILER_BARRIER()` is a matching-only annotation that emits no target instruction. It prevents EE GCC from applying the sibling/tail-call or scheduling transformation described above.

## Outcome

The released `WAVETEX_StaticInit` wrapper matched exactly.
