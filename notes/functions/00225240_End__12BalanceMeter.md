## Attempts

| # | Status | Byte score | Instruction score | Candidate |
| ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | different | 93.75 | 100.0 | `candidate.cpp` |
| 2 | matched | 100.0 | 100.0 | `candidate.cpp` |

### Attempt 2 notes

The released method forwards `(player_num, vert_meter, false)` to the global IGO. A symbol-preserving alias keeps the target repeated-bool `ibT2` mangling, and the trailing barrier preserves the normal call frame.

`KELLY_DECOMP_COMPILER_BARRIER()` is a matching-only annotation that emits no target instruction. It prevents EE GCC from applying the sibling/tail-call or scheduling transformation described above.

## Outcome

The released `BalanceMeter::End` wrapper matched exactly on attempt two.
