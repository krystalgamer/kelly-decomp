### Attempt 1 notes

A symbol-preserving trivial deleting destructor applies the low-bit delete guard.

`KELLY_DECOMP_COMPILER_BARRIER()` is a matching-only annotation that emits no target instruction. It prevents EE GCC from applying the sibling/tail-call or scheduling transformation described above.

## Outcome

The `EventManager` deleting destructor matched exactly.
