### Attempt 1 notes

A symbol-preserving wrapper reproduces the generated non-tail call to `signal::~signal`.

`KELLY_DECOMP_COMPILER_BARRIER()` is a matching-only annotation that emits no target instruction. It prevents EE GCC from applying the sibling/tail-call or scheduling transformation described above.

## Outcome

`gated_signal`'s generated destructor wrapper matched exactly.
