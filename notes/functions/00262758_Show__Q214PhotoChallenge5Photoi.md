### Attempt 1 notes

The released method forwards the photo texture, score address, and label to the global IGO. The symbol-preserving alias and trailing barrier reproduce the normal call frame.

`KELLY_DECOMP_COMPILER_BARRIER()` is a matching-only annotation that emits no target instruction. It prevents EE GCC from applying the sibling/tail-call or scheduling transformation described above.

## Outcome

The released challenge photo display wrapper matched exactly on the first attempt.
