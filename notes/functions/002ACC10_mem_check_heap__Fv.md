### Attempt 1 notes

The released system/debug heap consistency checks matched exactly with 0x6c-byte Heap records. The trailing empty barrier prevents a sibling tail jump for the second check.

`KELLY_DECOMP_COMPILER_BARRIER()` is a matching-only annotation that emits no target instruction. It prevents EE GCC from applying the sibling/tail-call or scheduling transformation described above.

## Outcome

The released heap consistency checker matched exactly on the first attempt.
