### Attempt 1 notes

A symbol-preserving destructor restores the parent vtable before delegating the `cg_none` object to its base.

`KELLY_DECOMP_COMPILER_BARRIER()` is a matching-only annotation that emits no target instruction. It prevents EE GCC from applying the sibling/tail-call or scheduling transformation described above.

## Outcome

The released `cg_none` destructor matched exactly.
