### Attempt 1 notes

The released virtual hook reverses receiver/argument registers and delegates to the light-specific region add.

`KELLY_DECOMP_COMPILER_BARRIER()` is a matching-only annotation that emits no target instruction. It prevents EE GCC from applying the sibling/tail-call or scheduling transformation described above.

## Outcome

The released light-source add-to-region wrapper matched exactly.
