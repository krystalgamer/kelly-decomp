### Attempt 1 notes

The released effect forwards its start width at offset four to `beam::set_thickness`.

`KELLY_DECOMP_COMPILER_BARRIER()` is a matching-only annotation that emits no target instruction. It prevents EE GCC from applying the sibling/tail-call or scheduling transformation described above.

## Outcome

The inline beam width start-value applicator matched exactly.
