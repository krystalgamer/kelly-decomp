- Reference source: `KS/SRC/so_data_block.cpp`
- Result: **matched**

### Attempt 1 notes

The released destroy helper conditionally deletes the allocated byte array.

`KELLY_DECOMP_COMPILER_BARRIER()` is a matching-only annotation that emits no target instruction. It prevents EE GCC from applying the sibling/tail-call or scheduling transformation described above.

## Outcome

The released `so_data_block::_destroy` implementation matched exactly.
