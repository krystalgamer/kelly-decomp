## Attempts

| # | Status | Byte score | Instruction score | Candidate |
| ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | different | 52.2727 | 45.4545 | `candidate.cpp` |
| 2 | compile_failed | 0.0 | 0 | `candidate.cpp` |
| 3 | matched | 100.0 | 100.0 | `size44-attack-wrapper-core.cpp` |

### Attempt 1 notes

The first source shape exposed a layout, loop-backedge, or sibling-call mismatch.

### Attempt 2 notes

The second attempt either exposed a candidate-generation syntax error or retained the loop branch schedule mismatch.

### Attempt 3 notes

The shared menu declarations and a local function pointer preserve the base
hook followed by the normal `FixValue` call.

## Outcome

The compiler barrier was removed.
